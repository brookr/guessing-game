"Make your own guessing game" assignment from Code Fellows

##Which subway station is yours?

This is a two-player guessing game. The way it works is as follows:

* Player 1 inputs a subway station from the Beijing Subway Map.
* Player 2 then guesses Player 1's subway station.
* If Player 2 is wrong, then they must guess again. However, if their guess is on the same subway line, then they are notified.
